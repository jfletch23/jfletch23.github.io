            text: "Consent has 3 fundamental aspects: manifestation, knowledge, and voluntariness. F.R.T. violates all 3 of these aspects. There is no manifestation of consent with F.R.T. since cameras are constantly recording from afar. In terms of the knowledge aspect, most people are unaware facial recognition technology is being used in places they frequent. This is because there is no way to know if cameras are being used for normal security purposes viewed by a human operator, or if the data is being fed into a facial recognition model and being compared across a database of faces. Lastly, consent must be made voluntarily and not reflexively. Most people will feel obligated to consent to F.R.T. if it is the only option to access a specific area where the technology is being deployed. In conclusion, the current state of facial recognition technology does not embody the principles of consent and it is unlikely in the future to embody those principles due to fundamental problems with how the technology works.",

According to a 2019 federal study, Native Americans and African American women had the highest rate of false positives for two different types of F.R.T. One reason for these biases is the lack of diversity in photos used to train the technology. These biases are particularly problematic since one of the primary uses of F.R.T. is law enforcement.",

Other data being sold is likely either anonymized or links to a group of people (i.e. expecting mothers). There are already examples of F.R.T. vendors selling facial data to law enforcement agencies to be used in their databases.",

While it is true private companies have always been able to deny entry to individuals, they are now able to do so in much larger numbers and with a higher success rate using F.R.T. This is problematic because the ability to efficiently deny entry to individuals using F.R.T. gives unchecked power to private companies to mistreat those they subjectively determine are dissidents.",

            text: "F.R.T has been defined by a lack of transparency. This is because the vendors that provide the technology consider how it works a trade secret. It is also often unclear what companies are using what vendors, which makes it hard to know who to direct questions to. In addition, there is a lot of obscurity around how faces get into these databases in the first place. Because F.R.T. vendors scrape billions of images from the Internet, it becomes muddled and unclear what specific website they got a specific image from. For example if you found out your face was in a database, you wouldnâ€™t know how to remove your face from the Internet since it would be unclear what website your face was scraped from.",
