                "and race while keeping accuracy stable (Melzi et al., 2024). Another study warned that generative " +
                "models 'lighten skin color of non-white faces and transform female features to be masculine,' " +
                "showing that synthetic data can also reinforce bias if not carefully designed (Jain et al., 2021). " +
                "Together, the findings highlight both the promise and the risks: synthetic data can protect privacy " +
                "and improve fairness, but it can also 'serve as a cautionary tale' if the generation process is biased.",

                "In many settings, lighting and contrast are hard to control, and light interacts differently with various skin tones. " +
                "As a result, face recognition often performs better on some demographic groups than others, raising fairness and ethical concerns. " +
                "One proposed solution is a group adaptive classifier, which applies different filters and attention to faces depending on demographic attributes, " +
                "ensuring important features are captured more equally. This method also uses an automated strategy to decide which layers adapt, " +
                "plus a new loss function to reduce performance gaps. Tests on major datasets show that it improves accuracy for under-represented groups " +
                "and reduces bias while maintaining overall recognition performance (Gong, Liu, & Jain, 2021).",

                "(U.S. Congress, 2019). Illinoisâ€™s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) protects identifiers like fingerprints and facial geometry, " +
                "prohibiting private entities from profiting on such data and requiring 'informed written consent' before collection (Biometric Information Privacy Act, 2023). " +
                "Courts ruled in Rosenbach v. Six Flags that damages must be paid even without proof of harm, a major win for individuals (Wang, 2024). " +
                "However, BIPA does not cover government use. Some cities, like San Francisco and Somerville, have banned government agencies from using FRT, " +
                "requiring oversight and privacy plans (Wang, 2024). Experts stress that Congress must build comprehensive regulation, treating biometric data " +
                "with the same protection as fingerprints, ensuring consent, oversight, and accountability.",
